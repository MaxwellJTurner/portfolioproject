<div>I trained at Mountainland Technical College, where I learned the Adobe Creative Cloud, especially Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Xd, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. I specialize in graphic design, motion design, and publishing design. <br>

    <div class="middle">I am most comfortable designing logos and any sort of branding associated with it, such as printed ads or social media ads, and I have lots of experience filming and editing as well.
    </div>
    <div>The process I'd normally like to do is to have a talk with my client and figure out what they want and need out of me, then spend some time coming up with rough sketches and ideas. After showing those to my client to see what ideas they like, I would then get to work designing it digitally. I would continually show them updated versions until it meets their expectations. For this, I charge $18 an hour.
