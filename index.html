<div class="paragraph">For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a desire to create things. Much of my youth was spent making comics inspired by Calvin & Hobbes and The Far Side, and I was often scolded by my teachers for doodling instead of taking notes. 
    I never learned my lesson, and that creative impulse led me to pursue a career in digital design. I graduated from 
    Mountainland Technical College’s Digital Design program in 2023. I am well versed in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Xd, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. </div>
